# README
This folder stores the templates and files necessary for the installation of operating systems.

The `packer_template.pkr.hcl` is the main Packer template used by the virtual machine `builder` binary to create the virtual machines.  The default Packer variables can be overridden via `pkrvars.hcl` files and `builder` binary flags.  For instance, there are `virtual_machine.pkrvars.hcl` files that overrides specific variables like default CPU, memory, disk size and VMware guest OS type.

The `overrides.pkrvars.hcl` should be created to fit your environment, for instance Packer variable values needed to connect to the VMware ESXi host.  Use the `overrides.pkrvars.hcl.example` file as a starting point.

The Packer variables `vm_linux_distro` and `vm_linux_distro_release` cannot be overriden by the `overrides.pkrvars.hcl` file because the `builder` binary passes these variables via `-var` flags options to the Packer process.

The operating system folders are structured as follows:

| File | Description |
| -- | -- | 
`<os-name>/<os-release>/virtual_machine.pkrvars.hcl` | Operating system release specific Packer variable overrides.
`<os-name>/<os-release>/templates` | Every file is processed as a Go `text/template` upon request, passing in the `templateVars` struct to the template on execution.
